Here’s what your comment should look like:

1. Use your real first name and email address in the comment form
2. Add smart, relevant ideas that expand on an article’s premise — read the article before you comment
3. Drop funny references or jokes that carry the conversation forward
4. Offer useful, constructive (not stupid or ugly) criticism
5. Any combination of the above

Here are some examples (not comprehensive, but you’ll get the idea) of types of comments that’ll ensure your failure to communicate, at least on Copyblogger:

- You don’t use your real first name or email address
- There are keywords and/or your business name in the name field of the comment form
- Comments that demonstrate you didn’t read, watch, or listen to the content
- Comments that simply restate or repeat information from the article and don’t carry the conversation forward
- Off-topic personal or professional rants
- Threats to us or other visitors
- Any form of defamation
- Racist or obscene nastiness
- Violation of anyone’s copyright, trademark, etc.
- Promotions about and/or links back to your product, service, or latest venture

Opps, again, this comment policy is just a copy of [CopyBlogger](https://www.copyblogger.com/comment-policy/), but it matches what I think it should be on my blog, too!
